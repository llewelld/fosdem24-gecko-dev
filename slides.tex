\begin{shadequote}[r]{Chris Lord, February 2016}
Gecko has limited embedding capability that is not well-documented, not well-maintained and not heavily invested in... We have at various points in history had embedding APIs/capabilities, but we have either dropped them (gtkmozembed) or let them bit-rot (IPCLite).
\end{shadequote}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{enumerate}
\item It's an old quote, but holds true today.
\item Chris Lord was a Mozilla engineer at the time.
\item He makes clear he's not criticising the implementations, but rather the strategic direction of Mozilla.
\item IPCLite is another name for EmbedLite.

\item Sailfish Browser ESR 60: February 2021
\item Sailfish Browser ESR 78: March 2022
\item Latest Firefox ESR: 115
\item By my estimate upgrading takes ~36 person-months
\end{enumerate}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{enumerate}
\item ESR stands for Extended Support Release, a gecko naming convention.
\item ESRs released roughly every 10 release cycles.
\item Supported for 12 weeks after next ESR release.
\item Receive security updates but not new features.
\item The Sailfish Browser has received semi-regular updates.
\item It was upgraded to ESR 60 in February 2021 and ESR 78 in March 2022.
\item However the most recent gecko ESR is 115.
\item Upgrading is a {\it lot\/} of work, mostly because of the patching required.
\item As gecko diverged from EmbedLite, patching increased; now have 99 patches, 104845 lines of diff.
\item Upgrading takes (my guess) around 36 person-months.

\begin{enumerate}
\item In August I decided to attempt the upgrade from ESR 78 to ESR 91.
\item Hoping my experience with 60 and 78 might help.

\vspace{1.5cm}
\begin{shadequote}[r]{Jay Wilson, January 2023}
A developer diary is where you write about developer things. It can be the record of what you worked on last, some decisions made by steak-holders in the product, and or a neat way to accomplish a task. It really comes down to what you want to put in it.
\end{shadequote}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dev diaries are common in the gaming community.
\item My first experience of a dev diary was with the crowd-funded Prison Architect in 2012.
\item Producer Mark Morris and Designer Chris Delay vlogged progress.
\item In the game industry they're often a marketing tool.
\item But my motiviation was different: first to help me code; second to involve the Sailfish community.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Help me remember what I'm doing day-to-day.
\item Force me to write down my processes every day.

\item Work consistently.

\item Users want to know about progress

\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Browser upgrades are seen as important by the community.
\item Having to wait, without any idea of progress, for the next browser is frustrating.
\item I needed help with: coding ideas; testing; other components (e.g. gcc, Rust); motiviation.

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item Coding this way takes about twice as long
\item Daily updates are great motivation, but also a bind
\item Best for tasks that can be split into daily pieces
\item Visual output helps
\end{enumerate}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}
\note{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Having to write everything down is time-consuming and makes coding take longer.
\item It's great to force yourself to work on something, but on some days it can be gruelling.
\item Challenging tasks that require a lot of thought to fix don't work so well.
\item Having visual results to share is great; which may explain why they're so popular in the games industry.

\item Users have helped solve problems; share ideas; test builds; generated blog content and graphics.
\item Sometimes I think I inhabit a different Internet to the one portrayed in the media.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A dev diary is especially good for open source projects where you can share code and others can contribute.
\item Some may be put off for fear of having to write interesting topics. That doesn't bother me because I don't. I just write what I do.
\item Work a couple of entries in advance.
